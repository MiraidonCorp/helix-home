# Rumathon I

June 17th to 20th, Basel, Switzerland (Adobe Office)

---

(See the [Hackathon Archive](./README.md) for past Operations Workshops and Hackathons)

### Rumathon???

This is a more or less spontanous workshop to ge the team together and work on things
that have come up, discuss ideas and generally have a good time. We are modeling this
after the Helix Hackathons, but due to the short notice, everything will be a bit more
bare-bones than usual. We are also meeting in the Basel office, but I'd ask you to
keep the number of sidetracks reasonable.

### Agenda

> I hear this is an rumathon workshop, are you going to taste RUM all day?

Trying to get as much of the virtual team together, the goal is to have high-bandwidth exchanges on the current state and next steps of RUM. We will try to keep it hands-on, so instead
of presentations, we will rely on code settling arguments, this means we won't be hacking all the time, there will also be plenty
of programming and coding.

The main purpose of the hackathon is social: allow the team to reconnect, meet new team members for the first time, and work on
stuff that won't fit neatly into a 45-minute Teams meeting.

### Location

> Where is this going to happen? Do you have a windowless conference room blocked out?

In the Basel office. We don't have a room yet, but it will likely have windows.

#### Travel

BSL. You are either there already, or you know the drill.

### Goals

> What are you planning to show at the end of the week?

Put down the topic and the people that would like to discuss it:

The theme of this offsite is ....

#### Ideas / Suggestions / Topics Collection

- Code Quality/Safe Deployments
- RUM Explorer
- Documentation
- Tier 1 infrastructure: review all components and make sure they have a proper "Tier 1" support (rum js delivery, rum collector...)
- rum-js and rum-enhancer: merge into one repo ? They work together anyway, easier integration testing, create and centralize various outputs (like 1 file with both or just sampleRUM for helix projects....), centrale documentation...
- minirum without instrumentation
- minirum config vs. feature flags
- `cwv2` rollout
- rum for product analytics
- who queries bigly?
- what's the data model
- cut down number of tracked checkpoints by 50%
